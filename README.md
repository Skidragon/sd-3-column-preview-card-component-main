### What I learned

I learned that I can use `box-shadow` property to mimic the `border` property in the learn more button. This made the button to not offset to a different position. I also reviewed the `unset` value and polish my flexbox styling and semantic HTML some more. Another thing to mention is I learned how to make images hide if it fails to load.
